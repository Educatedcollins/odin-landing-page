Second Odin Project (Making a Landing Page)

Hello Again! I am starting on a new project for Odin with the knowledge I've learned recently. 
The key concept I went over was FLEXBOX, A highly useful functional tool to align and get elements where I want them.
Hopefully we will be able to notice a improvement in my Website creation skills and things works as expected.

Thanks for reading and have a nice rest of your day.
